# Map Tool  
MapTool is a program for marking locations on a map with descriptions.  
Also contains detailed maps of Middle Earth.  
Originally created by Peter Malml√∂f (http://www.gitlab.com/PeterMalmlof), released as Opensource after his passing by his three sons Nicklas, Jonas and Mattias.

# Changelog  
Now works with Windows 10.  
Moved the source-files to their own folder.

# To Do  
1 relative pathing for files... alternatively, if the last file worked on doesn't exist anymore, forgo error message and just open 'open file'dialog.  
2 zooming in and out with mousewheel.  
3 If the map that was loaded last time no longer exists, show "open..."-dialog instead of an error-message.

# Current Errors:  

Exiting the program without opening a map gives seven error messages.
